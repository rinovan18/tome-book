<!--
  If you prefer to keep CSS/JS in separate files, you can define the "$library"
  variable, which is structured the same as a .libraries.yml definition.

<template>
  <div class="example-library">I use a separate library</div>
</template>

<?php

$library = [
  'css' => [
    'base' => [
      'css/example_library.css' => [],
    ],
  ],
