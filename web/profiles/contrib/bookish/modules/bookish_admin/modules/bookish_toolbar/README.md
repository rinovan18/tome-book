# Bookish Toolbar

This module provides an alternative to the core Toolbar module. It's much
simpler, and only displays the default Shortcut set plus a dedicated
Home/Logout button.

Core toolbar interferes with CKEditor 5 styling, and has frustrating behavior
(for example, it always expands on page load).

Alongside the Coffee contrib module, the experience is pretty good and you can
still navigate quickly to any admin page.
